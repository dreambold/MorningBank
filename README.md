# MorningBank
This application demonstrates the use of design patterns in a simple banking application

Modern design patterns based applications use a layered architecture and often start by declaring an
interface for a class before writing the code for the class. This also helps us accomplish loose coupling
between different layers so that one class can be easily replaced by another class as long as it
implements the same interface. This is particularly needed when testing individual layers or classes in
the application.
